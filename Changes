*   YAML parser supports extra attributes on tables.

*   All schema objects now support the extra attribute, so can
    have arbitary name/value data attached to them.

*   Refactoring: Added SQL::Translator::Schema::Object - base 
    class for all Schema objects.

*   Changes to MySQL Parser (Dave Howorth)
    - ignore INSERT statements
    - permit ALTER TABLE ADD FOREIGN KEY
    - allow trailing comma on last field in CREATE statements
    - collect the database name

*   TTSchema Producer
    - Can pass extra variables using tt_vars producer arg.
    - Can pass extra config using tt_conf producer arg.
    - Variables and config can be passed on the command line
      with --tt-var and --tt-conf options to sqlt.

*   Added schema filters.

*   MySQL Producer
    - Added 'mysql_table_type' extra attribute on tables.
    - Works out InnoDB tables from constraints.
    - mysql_charset and mysql_collate extra attributes for tables and fiels.
