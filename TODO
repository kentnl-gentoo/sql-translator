-   Diagram producer could benefit from some real graphing algorithms to
    better distribute the boxes.

-   Some way to deeply check to schema objects, e.g., for testing I
    parse a MySQL schema, translate to Oracle, then parse the created
    Oracle schema and want to check the two schema objects.

-   Add parsers and producers for Torque XML/DB schema
    (http://db.apache.org/torque/)

-   Allow xSV/Excel parsers to produce INSERT statements of data in source
    files, properly quoting strings

-   Allow pass through of INSERT statements (e.g., default data)
