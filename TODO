*   The regular Sybase parser is only just functional.  If you are
    interested in using Sybase, I would suggest serializing the schema
    (via YAML or Storable) using the DBI-Sybase parser and then
    manipulating that as you see fit. 

*   Add more DBI parsers!  These have the potential to be very
    thorough and far faster than parsing text files with
    Parse::RecDescent.

*   At least allow more pass-through of INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE
    statements

*   Add INSERT statements for xSV, Excel parsers to automatically
    create INSERTs for each row of data in the source file

*   Somehow merge ClassDBI producer with CGI::FormBuilder or Template
    Toolkit and some sort of automated CGI builder to create
    view/create/edit/delete forms for objects based on schema defs

*   Embetter the Diagram producer to use some real graphing algorithms
    to distribute the tables so that the lines don't overlap so badly

*   Integrate more with some standard XML schema representations,
    maybe like Torque DB (http://db.apache.org/torque/).  We've
    started messing around with XMI, too, but it isn't quite usable.

*   Possibly write a basic ANSI-92 SQL parser which could be extended
    when writing other new parsers.

*   Make as many "required" modules as possible optional.  This will
    require support in the Makefile, the tests, and the modules
    themselves (they'll need to die gracefully if prerequisites are
    not installed).

*   Support for precompiled Parse::RecDescent grammars.

*   More code generation producers, such as Java, PHP, and Python.

*   Integrate Module::Pluggable as a replacement for the _list method.
