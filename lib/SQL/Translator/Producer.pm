=head1 NAME

SQL::Translator::Producer - describes how to write a producer

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Producer modules designed to be used with SQL::Translator need to
implement a single function, called B<produce>.  B<produce> will be
called with the SQL::Translator object from which it is expected to 
retrieve the SQL::Translator::Schema object which has been populated 
by the parser.  It is expected to return a string.
